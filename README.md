## What is Numpy?
> NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:a powerful N-dimensional array object sophisticated (broadcasting) functions tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases. NumPy is licensed under the BSD license, enabling reuse with few restrictions.
## Implementation
The Python3 script uses the NumPy library to take slices (views) of a 3-D array list to check for possible pairs of winning tic tac toe games. The script accepts 9 'x' or 'o' characters as parameters when running the file. The script will print and either report that a solution was found or not found.
